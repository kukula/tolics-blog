Double-entry bookkeeping isn't just boring accounting  —  it's one of the most elegant software architecture patterns for handling money.

## The Problem with "Simple" Money Tracking

Most of us start the obvious way:

```sql
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE user_id = 123;
```

Simple, right? **Wrong.** This approach is a ticking time bomb. Race conditions lose transactions. No audit trail when money disappears. Compliance nightmares. Data corruption.

I learned this when a bug caused $50,000 to vanish. Three days of panic and manual database forensics to figure out what happened.

## Enter Double-Entry: The 500-Year-Old Tech Solution

Double-entry bookkeeping, invented in the 15th century, solves these problems with one simple rule:

**Every transaction affects at least two accounts, and debits must equal credits.**

Instead of updating balances directly, you record the movement of money:

```sql
-- User receives $100
INSERT INTO ledger_entries VALUES
  (uuid(), 'tx_123', 'user_123_cash', 100.00, 'debit'),
  (uuid(), 'tx_123', 'revenue', 100.00, 'credit');
```

The user's cash account goes up (debit), our revenue account goes up (credit). The books balance. Always.

## Why This Changes Everything

Every penny is tracked. Money can't just disappear  —  it has to go somewhere, and that somewhere is recorded forever.

If debits don't equal credits, something's wrong. The system literally won't let you create inconsistent data.

Want to see what a user's balance was on March 15th? Just sum up all their transactions until that date. No complex backup restoration needed.

## When NOT to Use Double-Entry

Don't overcomplicate simple systems. Gaming points, like/upvote systems, simple loyalty programmes, or prototypes are probably fine with a simple balance field.

**But if real money is involved, or if you need regulatory compliance, or if data integrity is critical, double-entry is your friend.**

## Getting Started

Start small. Add a ledger table alongside your existing balance fields. Record major transactions in both places initially. Compare the results. Gradually migrate to using the ledger as the source of truth. Keep balance fields as materialised views for performance.

## The Bottom Line

Double-entry bookkeeping isn't just about accounting  —  it's about building robust, auditable, debuggable financial systems.

The 15th century monks who invented this system understood something we often forget: when dealing with money, you can't afford to be sloppy.

Trust me, I wish I had learnt it before that $50,000 went missing.
