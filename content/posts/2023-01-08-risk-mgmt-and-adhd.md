As a software engineer with inattentive ADHD, managing risk and catching details that could break systems presents unique challenges. However, with the right strategies and tools, it's not only manageable — it can become a superpower.

## Core Strategies for ADHD Engineers

**Prioritise and Break Down Tasks**: ADHD brains struggle with task switching and overwhelming workloads. Break large features into 2-4 hour chunks. Use time-boxing to prevent hyperfocus burnout. Prioritise ruthlessly — not everything needs to be perfect.

**Embrace Checklists as External Memory**: Checklists aren't just helpful — they're essential for ADHD engineers. They serve as external memory and ensure consistency across projects. Make them comprehensive but not overwhelming. Organise logically with clear groupings. Use clear, actionable language. Mark items as "done" or "intentionally skipped".

**Strategic Break Management**: ADHD makes sustained focus difficult, but this isn't a weakness — it's a feature. Take breaks before you feel mentally exhausted. Use the Pomodoro Technique. Switch between different types of tasks to maintain engagement.

**Tool-Assisted Focus**: Leverage technology to manage distractions. Noise-cancelling headphones for open offices. Website blockers during deep work. IDE plugins that minimise visual clutter. Automated testing to catch what you might miss.

**Collaborative Quality Assurance**: Your colleagues are your safety net. Request code reviews for all changes. Pair programme on complex or risky features. Ask specific questions: "Did I handle the error cases correctly?" Create detailed pull request descriptions.

## Leverage ADHD Superpowers

ADHD comes with genuine advantages in engineering:
- **Hyperfocus**: Can solve complex problems others give up on
- **Creative problem-solving**: Sees unconventional solutions
- **High-level thinking**: Excels at system design and architecture
- **Crisis management**: Thrives under pressure when stakes are high

## The Meta-Strategy: Self-Awareness

The most important skill for ADHD engineers is developing self-awareness:
- Know your peak focus hours
- Recognise when you're making careless mistakes
- Understand which types of tasks drain vs. energise you
- Build systems that work with your brain, not against it

## Turning Challenges into Strengths

ADHD engineers often become exceptional architects and problem-solvers because they question assumptions others take for granted, see patterns across complex systems, excel at creative solutions when conventional approaches fail, and bring unique perspectives that homogeneous teams miss.

The key is building scaffolding around yourself that catches the details while amplifying your natural strengths. With the right systems in place, ADHD can be a significant advantage in software engineering.
