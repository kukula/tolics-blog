I'm not just fond of TODO lists  —  I'm in love with them. As a neurodivergent engineer with ADHD, they're not a productivity hack. They're assistive technology.

## External Memory

My brain excels at seeing connections, hyperfocusing on fascinating problems, and generating creative solutions. It's terrible at remembering what I was supposed to do 10 minutes ago, prioritising boring tasks, and not getting distracted by shiny problems.

TODO lists become my external prefrontal cortex  —  the part that handles executive function, which works differently in neurodivergent minds.

## Why Traditional Advice Fails

Most productivity advice assumes a neurotypical brain that naturally maintains focus and remembers tasks. "Just remember to do it." "Use willpower and discipline." That's like telling someone with glasses to "just see better."

TODO lists work *with* neurodivergent cognition, not against it.

## What Works

**Brain dumps** reduce anxiety. Getting everything out of your head frees mental bandwidth.

**Categorisation and priority** help ADHD brains sort noise from signal. Not everything is equally urgent, even if it feels that way.

**Limited active focus** (2-3 items maximum) prevents overwhelm. Context switching guidance for when blocked. Quick wins for dopamine on bad brain days.

**Energy-aware scheduling**: complex problem solving during high energy (10am-12pm), documentation during medium energy (2pm-4pm), administrative tasks during low energy (4pm-6pm).

## The Career Impact

My TODO obsession has measurable benefits: I never miss deadlines because everything lives in the system. I delegate effectively because I track follow-ups. Complex projects become manageable when broken into trackable tasks.

Managers notice engineers who consistently deliver and communicate well  —  traits enabled by good task management.

## For Fellow Neurodivergent Engineers

Start simple. Don't build a complex system immediately. Experiment fearlessly  —  what works for others might not work for your brain.

If you find yourself spending "too much" time organising, that's probably time well spent. The upfront investment pays dividends in execution.

Remember: you're not broken. You just need systems that work with your beautiful, complex, neurodivergent brain.

TODO lists let us compete on our strengths  —  creativity, deep thinking, pattern recognition  —  while compensating for our challenges with memory, attention, and executive function.
