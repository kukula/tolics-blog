"We've forgotten how to read books! Our attention spans are too short!"

Have you considered that new media might actually be better for learning? Faster, more convenient, and more aligned with how humans naturally process information?

## How Humans Actually Learn

Our ancestors evolved to recognise visual patterns — spotting ripe berries, tracking animals, identifying threats. They needed rapid environmental information processing for survival.

Reading is an artificial skill grafted onto brains designed for visual pattern recognition. We're not losing some natural ability — we're using our natural abilities more effectively.

## The Internet Changed Everything

Television was limited by broadcast — you couldn't access specific information when needed. The internet offers instant access, multiple modalities, immediate clarification, and tangential exploration.

Most knowledge work doesn't require memorizing every detail. It requires understanding patterns, knowing where to find information, and synthesizing insights from multiple sources.

## Different Media for Different Goals

Books excel at deep linear arguments and sustained contemplation. New media excels at rapid skill acquisition, visual demonstration, and interactive learning.

The problem isn't that we've lost the ability to read books. It's assuming there's only one "right" way to learn.

## Media Pluralism is Strength

We can watch a 10-minute video to understand a complex concept, read an in-depth article for nuance, discuss ideas in real-time with experts worldwide, and practice skills through interactive simulations.

This isn't intellectual decay — it's intellectual abundance.

The future belongs to people who fluidly move between media types, extracting value from each according to their strengths.
