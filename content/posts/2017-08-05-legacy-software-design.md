You start a summer delivery business. Light cargo, perfect weather. A motorcycle makes perfect sense — fast, efficient, badass.

Then you need more cargo. You add a trailer. Winter arrives. Extra wheels, weather protection, heating systems.

What started as a sleek motorcycle has become a frankenstein monster.

**When did it all go wrong?**

## The Original Decision Wasn't Wrong

Here's the insight: your initial choice was correct given the information you had. The problem wasn't the decision — it was failing to revisit and revise as circumstances changed.

## The Software Parallel

Software architecture follows the same pattern. Simple, elegant solution for current needs. Requirements change. Quick patches. More changes. More patches.

The original elegant design gets buried under layers of modifications until nobody understands how it works anymore.

## Understanding Legacy Code

Legacy code isn't old code — it's code where the reasoning has been lost. To truly understand code, you need to understand the decisions behind it.

## Red Flags of Emerging Legacy

Simple feature requires touching dozens of files. Team members are afraid to modify certain parts. Understanding features requires archaeological digs through commits. Mysterious conditionals nobody remembers the reason for.

## Prevention Strategies

Document decisions, not just code. Use Architecture Decision Records that capture context, decision, and consequences.

Embrace continuous refactoring as part of routine work. Question existing patterns regularly through architecture reviews.

Make change safe with comprehensive test coverage, feature flags, and monitoring.

## The Motorcycle to Car Transition

Sometimes the right answer is admitting your motorcycle has become a car.

Acknowledge the shift. Plan the transition. Execute gradually while maintaining service. Learn for next time.

## The Real Lesson

Good architecture isn't about predicting the future perfectly. It's about creating systems that fail gracefully when predictions are wrong and can be modified confidently when circumstances change.

Legacy code is what happens when we stop making conscious decisions about our systems.
