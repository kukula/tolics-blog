We're no longer just writing code. We're designing for modules owned by autonomous agents.

Each agent has its own domain of responsibility, state, and behaviour. The architect's job shifts from crafting logic to shaping relationships. The system must become **auto-creating** and **auto-healing** — detecting its own drift, correcting itself, evolving without constant human intervention.

## The Module: Agent-Owned Domain

Each module is a bounded context. One agent. One domain. One lifecycle.

The agent owns the module's internal logic, data, and state. It defines what it publishes and consumes. It monitors itself and reports when it needs help.

Think of each one as an actor — encapsulated state, defined behaviour, communicating only through messages.

## Integration Agent: The System Coordinator

The Integration Agent isn't a controller. It's the conductor of emergence.

We employ an **event mesh** — a dynamic fabric that routes events between producers and consumers. Modules remain loosely coupled yet synchronised. The Integration Agent watches the topology, sees bottlenecks and failure patterns, and intervenes when necessary.
Alternatively, **Erlang/Elixir's BEAM VM** with OTP already embodies these patterns natively — proven in production for decades of self-healing telecommunications systems.

## Runtime Substrate: WebAssembly as Habitat

Modules must deploy anywhere: cloud, edge, device. **WebAssembly** provides portable, sandboxed binary modules that load fast, isolate well, and run efficiently across environments.

In systems that must be auto-creating and auto-healing, the runtime must support rapid deployment, isolation, and roll-forward. Wasm delivers this.

## Designing for Self-Maintenance

Design for systems that don't need constant babysitting:

- **Health signals**: Modules emit meta-events — "I'm degraded", "I'm overloaded"
- **Feedback loops**: Events cascade, agents respond and adapt
- **Self-repair**: Agents detect failure patterns and trigger remediation
- **Evolution**: New agents spawn, old ones retire

## The Architectural Shift

The old paradigm: hand-craft code, deploy monoliths, tolerate downtime and manual fixes.

The new paradigm: assemble ecosystems. Modules spawn, heal, and retire. Agents talk through the event mesh. The runtime makes deployment fluid.

You stop asking "what code do we write?" and start asking "what module does what, how does it fail, and how does it self-heal?"

When you design with agents, event mesh, and WebAssembly, you're not just building software — you're sculpting a living system that auto-creates, auto-heals, and evolves.
