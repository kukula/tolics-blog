When we estimate a feature, we usually think about development time. But the real cost extends far beyond initial implementation. This is where [asking the right questions](/posts/hype-vs-pragmatic-development/) becomes crucial.

## The Iceberg of Feature Cost

**What we see (and estimate)**: Initial development time, code review and testing, basic documentation.

**What's hidden underwater**: Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes, performance monitoring and optimisation, security updates and vulnerability patches, compatibility updates as dependencies change, documentation updates, training for new team members, integration complexity with future features.

## The Maintenance Multiplier

A feature that takes 2 weeks to build might require:
- **6 months later**: Bug fix when edge case is discovered
- **1 year later**: Performance optimisation as usage grows
- **18 months later**: Security patch for underlying dependency
- **2 years later**: Refactoring to accommodate new related features
- **3 years later**: Major rewrite when business requirements change

The total lifetime cost can be 3-10x the initial development cost.

## Especially Expensive: Isolated Features

Some features are particularly expensive to maintain: separate landing pages (different deployment pipeline, separate monitoring), custom integrations (API changes from third parties, authentication token management), and feature flags that never get removed (code complexity grows, testing matrix expands exponentially).

## The Counterintuitive Economics

Sometimes a solution that sounds complex initially can be cheaper long-term:

**Example: Authentication**
- **Simple approach**: Build custom auth system (2 weeks)
- **Complex approach**: Integrate with enterprise SSO (6 weeks)

**5-year cost analysis**:
- Custom auth: 2 weeks + ongoing security updates + password reset support + compliance audits + breach response
- Enterprise SSO: 6 weeks + occasional integration updates

The "complex" solution is often cheaper over time.

## Hidden Costs That Add Up

**Testing Overhead**: Every feature increases the testing matrix â€” unit tests, integration tests, regression testing, performance testing, security testing.

**Documentation Debt**: Initial documentation is rarely complete, goes stale as features evolve, and new team members need examples and context.

**Cognitive Load**: More features equals more mental complexity for developers, support teams, and product managers.

## The ROI Calculation

**Traditional ROI**: (Revenue - Development Cost) / Development Cost

**True ROI**: (Revenue - Total Lifetime Cost) / Total Lifetime Cost

Where Total Lifetime Cost includes initial development, ongoing maintenance, support and documentation, opportunity cost of team focus, integration complexity, and technical debt accumulation.

## Making Better Decisions

Before saying yes to a feature:
1. Estimate the 3-year total cost, not just development time
2. Consider how it fits into the broader architecture
3. Plan for deprecation and removal from day one
4. Design for maintainability, not just functionality

Every feature is an ongoing commitment. Choose your commitments wisely.

The features you don't build cost nothing to maintain forever.
