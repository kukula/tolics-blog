## Turn Technical Chaos Into Scalable Systems

Your engineering team is smart, but velocity is dropping. Features that took days now take weeks. Your best engineers are burning out. AWS costs keep climbing while performance gets worse.

I've seen this pattern at StackAdapt, Instacart, CultureAmp, Seek, and a dozen startups. And I know how to fix it.

## Real Results From Recent Engagements

- Integrated into Rails platform via Sidekiq background jobs
- **Impact**: Saved 14+ hours/week in manual moderation

## The Problems I Solve

### For Engineering Managers
- **Velocity declining** as codebase complexity grows — features that took days now take weeks
- **New hires taking months** to contribute — 3-6 month onboarding for simple changes
- **Technical decisions paralysed** — too many opinions, not enough experience
- **"Quick wins" becoming expensive mistakes** — shortcuts compound into technical debt

### For CTOs
- **Board asking hard questions** about technical strategy and timeline delays
- **Rewrite vs. incremental improvement** — $2M bet or strategic refactoring?
- **Technical risk assessment** for acquisitions, fundraising, or major pivots
- **Build vs. buy** for critical infrastructure — when to invest, when to integrate

## How I Help

### Architecture Health Check
*1-2 week engagement*

Deep technical assessment of your systems, team, and processes.

**What you get:**
- Technical debt assessment with quantified business impact
- Scalability bottleneck analysis with timeline projections
- Concrete 3, 6, 12-month roadmap with priority rankings
- Risk assessment of current architectural decisions
- Specific recommendations based on 20+ years building similar systems

**Investment:** $15,000 - $25,000

**Example outcome**: Identified that "slow deployments" weren't a CI/CD problem — they were a test suite architecture problem. Fixed root cause, deployment time dropped from 45min to 8min.

### Technical Advisory
*Ongoing retainer relationship*

Strategic guidance for sustained architectural improvement.

**What you get:**
- Monthly architecture reviews and strategic planning
- Technical hiring support (interview design, candidate evaluation)
- Real-time consultation on major technical decisions
- Mentoring for senior engineers transitioning to architecture roles
- Access to 20+ years of pattern matching across industries

**Investment:** $5,000 - $10,000/month (6-month minimum)

**Example outcome**: Guided team through Rails 6→7 upgrade while simultaneously migrating 2M users to new authentication system. Zero downtime, completed 3 months ahead of schedule.

### Crisis Intervention
*Immediate availability for urgent situations*

Senior expertise when you need it most.

**What you get:**
- Production emergency troubleshooting and resolution
- Pre-acquisition technical due diligence
- Legacy system rescue and modernisation strategy
- Expert technical leadership during team transitions
- 20+ years of "I've seen this break before" pattern recognition

**Investment:** Starting at $2,500/day

**Example outcome**: Stabilised production system experiencing cascading failures. Identified root cause (connection pool exhaustion), implemented circuit breakers, system recovered in 4 hours instead of projected 3 days.

## My Approach: Pragmatic Over Perfect

I don't believe in silver bullets. Every architecture decision depends on your team, constraints, and business context.

**I focus on:**
- **Solutions your team can maintain** — not impressive GitHub demos
- **Incremental improvements** that deliver value while reducing risk
- **Boring technology that works** over exciting technology that breaks
- **Asking the right questions** before proposing solutions
- **Concrete metrics** — not vague promises

**This philosophy has delivered:**
- 67% reduction in incident resolution time (StackAdapt observability)
- 70% reduction in operational overhead (Seek automation, Redbubble self-service)
- 40% API response time improvement (StackAdapt GraphQL gateway)
- 35% API latency reduction (Redbubble PostgreSQL optimisation)
- 30% infrastructure cost reduction (CultureAmp AWS optimisation)
- Zero-downtime migrations serving millions of users (CultureAmp, Seek)

## My Background

**20+ years** building and fixing systems at high-growth companies:

## Who This ISN'T For

I'm not the right choice if you're:
- **Looking for staff augmentation** — I multiply your team's effectiveness, not add headcount
- **A team smaller than 3 engineers** — You need builders, not strategy
- **Seeking the cheapest option** — I provide premium expertise for teams ready to invest in excellence
- **Wanting bleeding-edge for its own sake** — I favour boring, proven solutions your team can maintain
- **Not ready to empower your team** — My solutions require giving engineers ownership

## Red Flags: When You Need Help Now

**If 3+ of these apply, we should talk:**

- Deployments take hours and often fail
- "Simple" features consistently take weeks instead of days
- Engineers actively avoid certain parts of the codebase
- Customer-reported bugs increasing month over month
- Your best engineers are burning out or leaving
- Technical discussions end in deadlock
- You're considering a full rewrite because "it's the only way"
- Board asks questions about "technical debt" you can't quantify
- New features consistently break existing functionality
- Monitoring alerts are ignored or constantly firing

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do you work with remote teams?**
Yes, 80% of my clients are fully remote or hybrid. I've led distributed teams across US, EU, and APAC time zones.

**What size companies do you work with?**
Primarily startups and scale-ups (10-200 engineers), though I also advise larger enterprises on specific modernisation projects.

**Do you write code?**
Yes — I maintain hands-on development while providing architecture and strategy. I led 8-person teams at StackAdapt while still shipping features.

**How do you measure success?**
By your team's improved velocity, reduced operational overhead, and confidence in technical decisions. Every engagement includes specific, measurable outcomes.

**What if we need ongoing support?**
Most clients transition to a monthly advisory retainer. I believe in building long-term relationships, not one-time transactions.

**What makes you different from other consultants?**
20+ years of hands-on experience at high-growth companies. I've led teams, shipped features, and fixed production systems. I know what works at scale because I've built it.
